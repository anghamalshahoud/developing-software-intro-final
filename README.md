I installed typescript using:
```
npm install -g typescript --save-dev
```
And I added NPM scripts so that you can, in one cli command each:
- compile
- start
- compile & start

### To compile run:
```
tsc
```
### To start run:
```
node dist/index.js
```

### To compile & start run:
```
npm run compile:start
```
